The Book Both is management system to view availabe books at a local phone booth library. The application was created to allow users to view the available books prior to visiting a phone booth library and to add a book that is currently available. 

A phone booth library is a repurposed phone booth to accomodate books for the community to borrow. The idea is that a reader can borrow a book and return it later, or leave another book in it's place. 


# Purpose and Target Audience:
 **Problem Statement:** The Phone booth libraries are located all across the country making it possible for individuals to borrow and donate books to the collections at specified phone booths. The user finds it difficult to know which books are available prior to reaching the phone booth and is unable to communicate to other users that they have added a new book.

**Purpose:** This book management app will list the available books and show if they are available to borrow. Users will also be able to add a book to the collection as well edit and delete the book they added to ensure the application is up-to-date.

**Target Audience:** The primary target audience include avid readers who enjoy using phone booth libraries as well as individuals who want to be apart of a reading community where they can share their thoughts on the books they have completed in the collection.
